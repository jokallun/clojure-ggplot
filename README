# ggplot-clj

This project is intended to provide a easy and flexible way for plotting data with clojure. 
The grand goal would be to imitate the ggplot package for R ( http://had.co.nz/ggplot/ ).  
 
Plotting utility wii be built on processing (http://www.processing.org/) , using the
clojure wrapper for processing written by Roland Sadowski (https://github.com/rosado/clj-processing)
